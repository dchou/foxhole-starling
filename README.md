# Introducing Feathers

Hi, everyone! The project you may have known as "Foxhole" is now called "Feathers". After I started focusing on [Starling Framework](http://starling-framework.org/) for my components and left the old display list behind, I wanted to give them a better name that fits more closely with the Starling branding. After much consideration, I think that "Feathers" fits my desire perfectly. A bird's feathers provide functional and aesthetic benefits that I think closely match how user interface components can enhance a graphics library.

For more information, visit [feathersui.com](http://feathersui.com/). You can still access [Feathers on Github](http://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers) for the full source code.

Thank you for using Feathers. Happy Coding!
